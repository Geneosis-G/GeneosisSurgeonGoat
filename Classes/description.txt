[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]Actually, this one was easier than expected :) The original idea proposed on the request thread was to be able to give the AI of a NPC to another. I also used this mod to fullfill a request that was made several time about having a way to make NPCs passive.
So the first thing I made in this mod was to store the important informations about the character AIs into a new brain object I made (based on the one you can find in GoatZ). Then I tried to give them to another NPC to see what happen... And it was working surprisingly well compared to what I thought :D All I had to do was storing a few more informations about the NPC animations and physics in order to make transplanted creature behave a bit more like the owner of their brain ^^
When all that was done, there was another fun idea I had in mind for an easter egg in this mod... Basically I wanted to make a little AI that will be able to swap from one body to another :p So that's how I made the Swapper: it will permanently look for another body, and swap its AI with the one in that body when close enough ^^
As always with new AIs, it took a few days to fix all the little bugs... For example I discovered a really funny but also annoying bug when you swap two AIs: the regular AI given to most NPC became agressive against the player X) I was able to figure out what was causing this behaviour and fix it, so it's no longer a problem ^^
